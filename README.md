Part of #codethatstuff by @aamish.ahmad.beg on Instagram.


## Made with #flutter
It was incredibly easy to implement this ... Aamish, still being a school student, made this stuff in under 5 hours (snack and snore time included).

This was a test of Flutter's claim to provide a fast-paced development experience, and it did not falter. The speed of development was blazing fast, with minimum time spent writing repeatitive stuff.
  
## Decluttered UI Architechture
  This UI Challenge also demonstrates scalable UI architechture. Is it the best ? By absolutely no means. But it is a nice starting point.
